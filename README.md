### Installation
The tool is a Django module, intended to be installed in a larger Django project. But it can run on its own in a Mac or Linux environment, assuming you have the setup dependencies of pip, virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper installed. Here's how:

Go to where you want the project to be created, make a virtual environment, clone this repository (or your own fork of it) and install requirements and settings.
```bash
mkvirtualenv retirement
git clone https://github.com/cfpb/retirement.git
cd retirement
setvirtualenvproject
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp test_settings.py settings.py
```

Build the front-end requirements and the JavaScript files.
  ```bash
  ./frontendbuild.sh
  ```

Create a standalone database and load the app's tables and content.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata retiredata.json
```

Fire up a development server.
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The "Before You Claim" page should load at `localhost:8000/retirement/before-you-claim/`.

### Usage notes
- The app is set up to run inside [consumerfinance.gov](http://www.consumerfinance.gov), so if you run it locally, some fonts may not load because of [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) policies.
- The app sends http requests to the Social Security Administration's [Quick Calculator](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/index.html) to get benefit estimates for the chart.

### How to run software tests
- You can use nose to run the Python test suite and see code coverage information:

  ```bash
  ./pytest.sh
  ```
- You can run the JavaScript tests with:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
